# MacroCalculator
The whole project has been developed using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it is an application to calculate your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) and your food macros. No framework or canvas has been used. The entire application has been designed with CSS and the logic has been developed by handling the DOM with JavaScript, creating and removing HTML elements dynamically.
